### 🖨️ Print
Using `print()` to display output in the console.

### 📦 Variables
Storing data in variables so it can be reused and manipulated later.

### ⌨️ Input
Using `input()` to collect information from the user and make programs interactive.

### 🐞 Debugging
Finding and fixing errors in code to ensure the program runs correctly.
